# Whoa scout, surprised you ended up here!
Well since you are here, let’s learn some nerdy things about <br />the site.

#### The project…
…is for Kyle Bacon’s senior thesis in the [Portland State Graphic Design](http://psu.gd?target=_blank) program. It is heavily inspired by camping and scout field manuals because the forest of the digital world is a scary place and should be accessible for all. This guide is meant to get people up to speed in creating accessible Internet experience as quickly as possible in a fun and quirky manner.

This site is by no means 100% complete as of launch and a project I hope to maintain, perfect, and build upon in the future to keep up with changes in technologies and improving the learning experience. (It's also open source, so slap in a PR if you'd like.)

#### The content…
…was written with love by Kyle Bacon referencing quite a few sources that are way smarter than him to provide well said and friendly language for all campers

#### The typefaces…
…for headings is [Century Gothic Bold](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/century-gothic/bold?target=_blank), using a modular scale of 1.125, served locally by the [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com?target=_blank). The body type face is [Noto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif?target=_blank) served by Google Fonts. It’s a typeface that supports many languages and glyphs to always provide the best reading experience. The designs of the typeface were heavily scrutinized to provide a great reading experience and give the look and feel of a camp manual.

#### The color palette…
…is accessible and inspired by summer camps.

#### The website…
…is built using the flat-file [GRAV CMS](https://getgrav.org?target=_blank) with a custom CSS framework built by Kyle Bacon. The badge and account system is managed by a combination of hand-crafted vanilla JS, tears, and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com?target=_blank) by Google.

#### The illustrations…
…were crafted with beer and coffee by Kyle Bacon.
